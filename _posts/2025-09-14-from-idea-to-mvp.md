## From Idea to MVP: Building Rwanda's First Comprehensive Real Estate Platform

Every developer dreams of building something that solves a real-world problem. For me, that dream was Murugo, a real estate platform designed to modernize the property market in Rwanda. This is the story of how Murugo went from a simple idea to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP).

### The Problem: A Fragmented Market

Finding a property in Rwanda often involves a frustrating mix of word-of-mouth referrals, endless scrolling through social media groups, and dealing with outdated listings. I saw a clear need for a centralized, reliable platform that could connect landlords, renters, and buyers in a seamless and efficient way.

### The Vision: A One-Stop Shop for Real Estate

My vision for Murugo was simple: create a platform that would be:

- **Comprehensive:** A single place for all property listings, from apartments to commercial spaces.
- **User-Friendly:** An intuitive interface for both property seekers and landlords.
- **Trustworthy:** Verified listings and secure communication channels.

### Choosing the Right Tools: Why Laravel?

For the foundation of Murugo, I chose Laravel, a powerful PHP framework. Here's why:

- **Rapid Development:** Laravel's elegant syntax and built-in features allowed me to build the MVP quickly.
- **Scalability:** I knew that Murugo would need to grow, and Laravel's architecture is designed for scalability.
- **Ecosystem:** Laravel has a vast ecosystem of packages and tools that I could leverage for features like authentication, image handling, and more.

### Building the MVP: Core Features

The MVP focused on the essential features needed to launch the platform:

1.  **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login for landlords and renters.
2.  **Property Listings:** A simple form for landlords to create and manage their properties.
3.  **Search and Filtering:** Basic search functionality to help users find properties based on location, price, and type.
4.  **Property Details Page:** A dedicated page for each property with images, descriptions, and contact information.

### Challenges and Lessons Learned

Building the MVP was not without its challenges. I had to make decisions about the database, server configuration, and deployment process. In the next post, I'll dive into the "Database Dilemma" and explain why I started with SQLite and when I knew it was time to switch to something more powerful.

Stay tuned for the next chapter in the Murugo journey!
