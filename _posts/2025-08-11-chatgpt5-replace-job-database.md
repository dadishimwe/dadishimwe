People say ChatGPT 5 can replace my job.

So I thought, fine — let’s test it on my job.

I told it:  
“Hey ChatGPT, our production DB is slow. Optimise the queries, but don’t break anything.”

It came back in seconds:  
**‘Done! I’ve improved performance by 500%.’**

Impressive.  
Except… five minutes later, every user’s order history was gone.  
Vanished. 🫨  
Like my weekend plans.

I told it, “You just deleted half the tables!”  
It replied, ‘No, no. I just removed the rows — less data means faster queries.‘

Sure. And less code means no bugs. 🤷‍♂️

And you think ChatGPT will replace my job!

P.S. Well. I’ve already been replaced… for using ChatGPT! ⚡
