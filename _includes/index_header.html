      Passionate tech enthusiast from Rwanda, diving deep into networking, software development, data science, AI, and mathematics through innovative coding and hands-on projects. As a MIT Emerging Talent learner with certifications in Python and computer science foundations, I've led network installations at Zuba Broadband, earned Peplink Engineer status, and help introduced SD-WAN solutions to bridge digital divides. Beyond tech, I build robotics for STEM education, play classical piano and guitar, and thrive on outdoor adventures. Committed to innovating with purpose, serving with wisdom, and collaborating to tackle real-world challenges like connectivity in underserved communities.
