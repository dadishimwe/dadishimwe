layout: project
---


A comprehensive technical deep-dive into building Rwanda's first real estate platform. This series documents the complete journey from initial concept to production deployment, covering every major challenge and decision along the way.

## Project Overview

Murugo is a real estate platform designed to modernize the property market in Rwanda. Built with Laravel and deployed using Docker, the platform connects landlords, renters, and buyers in a seamless and efficient way.

## The Complete Journey

{% assign murugo_posts = site.posts | where: "tags", "murugo" | sort: "date" %}

{% for post in murugo_posts %}
### {{ forloop.index }}. [{{ post.title }}]({{ post.url }})
**{{ post.date | date: "%B %d, %Y" }}**

{% if post.title contains "From Idea to MVP" %}
The story of how Murugo went from a simple idea to a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Learn about the problem we set out to solve, why we chose Laravel, and the core features that made up our initial release.
{% elsif post.title contains "Database Dilemma" %}
Every developer faces the database choice dilemma. This post explores why we started with SQLite for rapid prototyping and the performance bottlenecks that forced us to migrate to PostgreSQL.
{% elsif post.title contains "Property Management Hell" %}
Managing thousands of properties requires a robust system. This post covers the challenges of building a scalable property management system and the solutions we implemented.
{% elsif post.title contains "Image Upload Chaos" %}
File uploads can make or break a real estate platform. Learn about the challenges of handling image uploads at scale and the solutions we implemented for storage, processing, and delivery.
{% elsif post.title contains "Navigation Nightmare" %}
User experience is crucial for any platform. This post covers the challenges of building an intuitive navigation system and the user research that guided our design decisions.
{% elsif post.title contains "Session Security" %}
When building a platform that will handle payments, standard security isn't enough. Learn about the multi-layered session security approach we implemented to protect our users.
{% elsif post.title contains "Docker Deployment" %}
The final chapter covers our journey from local development to production deployment using Docker. Learn about the challenges of containerization and the automated deployment process we created.
