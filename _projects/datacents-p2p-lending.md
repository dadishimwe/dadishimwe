## Datacents - P2P Lending Default Prediction

A collaborative machine learning project focused on predicting default risk in peer-to-peer lending platforms. This project was developed as part of a team effort to create robust models for financial risk assessment.

### Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop predictive models that can accurately assess the likelihood of loan defaults in P2P lending platforms. This helps lenders make informed decisions and reduces financial risk in the lending ecosystem.

### Key Objectives

- **Risk Assessment**: Predict the probability of loan default
- **Feature Engineering**: Identify key factors influencing default rates
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning algorithms
- **Business Impact**: Provide actionable insights for lending decisions

### Dataset & Features

The project utilizes comprehensive lending data including:

- **Borrower Information**: Credit history, income, employment status
- **Loan Characteristics**: Amount, term, interest rate, purpose
- **Market Conditions**: Economic indicators, market trends
- **Behavioral Data**: Payment patterns, communication history

### Technical Approach

#### Data Preprocessing
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and outliers
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating derived features and transformations
- **Data Validation**: Ensuring data quality and consistency
- **Feature Selection**: Identifying most predictive variables

#### Model Development
- **Multiple Algorithms**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Networks
- **Cross-Validation**: Robust model evaluation using k-fold cross-validation
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing model parameters for best performance
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models for improved accuracy

#### Evaluation Metrics
- **Accuracy**: Overall prediction accuracy
- **Precision & Recall**: Balanced evaluation of model performance
- **ROC-AUC**: Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve
- **F1-Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall

### Team Collaboration

This project was developed as part of a collaborative team effort, demonstrating:

- **Version Control**: Git-based collaboration and code management
- **Code Review**: Peer review processes for quality assurance
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive project documentation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Team presentations and knowledge transfer

### Technical Stack
